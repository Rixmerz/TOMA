# TOMA - Tmux Orchestrator MCP Adapter

TOMA (Tmux Orchestrator MCP Adapter) is an MCP server that provides AI-powered tmux session management and orchestration capabilities. It migrates the functionality of the original Tmux-Orchestrator workspace tool into a Model Context Protocol server, eliminating token burning from manual documentation reading and providing intelligent automation tools.

## Features

### Core Tmux Management
- **Session Management**: Create, list, and manage tmux sessions
- **Window Operations**: Create, rename, kill, and monitor tmux windows
- **Content Capture**: Capture and analyze window content
- **Inter-Agent Communication**: Send messages between Claude agents in different windows

### Engineer Session Management
- **Simplified Session Creation**: Create "ingeniero" (engineer) sessions with single window initialization
- **Generic Engineer Briefing**: Non-role-specific briefing that allows internal sub-agent delegation
- **Project Idea Distribution**: Send project ideas and requirements to engineer sessions
- **Status Monitoring**: Request and track progress updates from engineers

### Scheduling and Automation (PM-Only Tools)
- **Task Scheduling**: Schedule orchestrator check-ins and progress reviews (PM use only)
- **Automated Standups**: Schedule daily engineer standups (PM use only)
- **Progress Monitoring**: Automated progress tracking and reporting (PM use only)
- **Smart Notifications**: Context-aware notifications and reminders (PM use only)

### Communication Tools
- **Message Broadcasting**: Send messages to multiple engineer sessions
- **Inter-Engineer Communication**: Facilitate communication between different engineer instances
- **Status Updates**: Automated status update requests and tracking

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rixmerz/TOMA.git
   cd TOMA
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## MCP Configuration

Add TOMA to your MCP configuration file (typically `~/.config/mcp/config.json`):

```json
{
  "toma": {
    "command": "node",
    "args": ["/path/to/TOMA/dist/index.js", "--stdio"],
    "env": {
      "NODE_ENV": "production",
      "TOMA_LOG_LEVEL": "info",
      "TOMA_SAFETY_MODE": "true"
    }
  }
}
```

## Architecture and Use Case

### Intended Usage Pattern
TOMA is designed for a specific PM-Engineer workflow:

1. **Project Manager (PM)**: A free CLI agent with TOMA MCP access
   - Creates engineer sessions using `create_engineer_session`
   - Uses scheduling tools to monitor progress
   - Sends project ideas and coordinates between engineers
   - Has access to all TOMA tools

2. **Engineer**: A single tmux window labeled "ingeniero"
   - Receives generic briefing allowing internal sub-agent delegation
   - Manages specialized sub-agents internally (frontend, backend, testing, etc.)
   - Does NOT use TOMA's scheduling tools (PM-only)
   - Communicates with PM through TOMA's messaging system

### Key Design Principles
- **Single Window**: Engineers get one tmux window, not multiple role-specific windows
- **Internal Delegation**: Engineers handle role specialization via internal sub-agents
- **PM Oversight**: Only PM uses scheduling and monitoring tools
- **Simple Interface**: TOMA serves as a bridge between PM and engineer instances

## Usage Examples

### Creating an Engineer Session
```typescript
// Create a generic engineer session (single window labeled "ingeniero")
await mcp.callTool('create_engineer_session', {
  session_name: 'ingeniero-frontend',
  project_path: '/path/to/project',
  briefing: 'Focus on React components and UI improvements. Use internal sub-agents for specialized tasks.'
});
```

### Sending a Project Idea
```typescript
await mcp.callTool('send_project_idea', {
  session_name: 'ingeniero-backend',
  title: 'API Authentication System',
  description: 'Implement JWT-based authentication',
  requirements: ['JWT tokens', 'User registration', 'Password reset'],
  priority: 'high',
  estimated_hours: 16
});
```

### Scheduling Progress Reviews (PM-Only)
```typescript
// PM schedules review in 30 minutes with proper session targeting
await mcp.callTool('schedule_progress_review', {
  session_name: 'ingeniero-frontend',
  minutes: 30,
  pm_session_name: 'pm-main',      // PM's actual tmux session
  pm_window_index: 0               // PM's tmux window (default: 0)
});
```

### Broadcasting Messages
```typescript
await mcp.callTool('broadcast_message', {
  sessions: ['ingeniero-frontend', 'ingeniero-backend'],
  message: 'Daily standup in 10 minutes. Please prepare your updates.'
});
```

### Strategic Session Usage Example

You are currently in the tmux session called: `<session_name>`; take on the role of `<role>`; use the 'toma' tools, create an `<engineer>` and give them `<instructions or path with instructions>`, make them create a default `<project_type>` project — that is the only goal. And for yourself, create a `<schedule_duration>` schedule.


## PM Session Targeting

### Problem Solved
The original scheduling functionality had an architectural issue where scheduled tasks executed in isolation and couldn't properly communicate with tmux terminals where the PM was located.

### Solution: PM Session Parameters
All scheduling tools now accept optional PM session targeting parameters:

- `pm_session_name`: The tmux session name where the PM is running
- `pm_window_index`: The tmux window index where the PM is located (default: 0)

### Enhanced Scheduling Tools
```typescript
// All scheduling tools now support PM session targeting:

// Basic task scheduling
await mcp.callTool('schedule_task', {
  minutes: 15,
  note: 'Check engineer progress',
  pm_session_name: 'pm-main',
  pm_window_index: 0
});

// Progress reviews
await mcp.callTool('schedule_progress_review', {
  session_name: 'ingeniero-backend',
  minutes: 60,
  pm_session_name: 'pm-main'
});

// Orchestrator checks
await mcp.callTool('schedule_orchestrator_check', {
  minutes: 30,
  pm_session_name: 'pm-main'
});

// Engineer standups
await mcp.callTool('schedule_engineer_standup', {
  session_name: 'ingeniero-frontend',
  minutes: 480,
  pm_session_name: 'pm-main'
});
```

### Benefits
- ✅ **Fixed Isolation Issue**: Scheduled notifications now reach the correct PM location
- ✅ **Improved Workflow**: Messages delivered to PM's actual tmux session/window
- ✅ **Backward Compatible**: Optional parameters with sensible defaults
- ✅ **Better Targeting**: PM session parameters override default target windows

## Migration from Original System

2. **MCP Integration**: Native MCP protocol support for better AI integration
3. **Enhanced Automation**: Intelligent scheduling and monitoring tools
4. **Better Communication**: Structured inter-agent communication
5. **Simplified Architecture**: Single-window engineer sessions with internal sub-agent delegation
6. **Fixed Scheduling**: PM session targeting ensures notifications reach the correct location

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### 🚨 Recurrent Issue: augment-cursor MCP Execution

There is a recurrent issue with **cursor-agent** where it sometimes fails to execute MCP correctly. This is not a bug in MCP itself, but rather a "skill issue" depending on the agent assigned (especially if agent selection is set to auto). If the process freezes or gets stuck, simply resend the message—eventually, an agent with sufficient MCP handling skills will be assigned and the problem will resolve itself.

- This is not a TOMA or MCP error.
- If stuck, just retry until a capable agent is assigned.
- No further action is needed; the issue is agent-dependent.

🚨 If you encounter this, do **not** report it as a bug—it's a known limitation of agent skill variance!
